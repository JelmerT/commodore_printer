COMMODORE 64 USB PRINTER INTERFACE
=================

USB interface for old Commodore printers based on Arduino. (MPS803, HR-5C, ... )

Code adapted from http://www.rantakokko.net/tapani/blog/2009/06/02/interfacing-old-commodore-64-printers-with-arduino/
All credit goes to Tapani Rantakokko, I just made some dirty alterations to make it run on an Arduino Leonardo and removed the extra external inverter.

I didn't do long term tests with this setup, so don't blame me if your printer catches fire.
Code needs to be improved on Data_in and Data_out lines, they are externally bridged at the moment.
